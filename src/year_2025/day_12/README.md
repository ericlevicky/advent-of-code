# Day 12: TODO

Scaffolding for Advent of Code 2025 Day 12 lives here. Drop the official puzzle text in this file once the problem unlocks so future-you remembers the exact rules.

## Getting Started

1. Paste the sample puzzle input into `test.txt` and your personal input into `input.txt`.
2. Flesh out `parse_input` inside `code.py` so it converts the raw text into whatever data model the puzzle needs.
3. Implement `part1` and `part2`, keeping the file-loading helper in place so the tests keep working.

## Development Notes

- `code.py` currently exposes `parse_input`, `part1`, and `part2`. Each part reads from the local folder, making it easy to run with different files.
- Unit tests live under `tests/year_2025/day_12`. Update those tests with the real expected values once you have solutions.
- Feel free to document edge cases or gotchas from the puzzle statement in this README as you solve the challenge.
